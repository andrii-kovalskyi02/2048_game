## How to Play

The 2048 Game is a puzzle that challenges your strategy and logic. To play, follow these simple rules:

- **Game Controls**: You can play the game using your keyboard's arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) on desktop computers. On touch devices like smartphones and tablets, swipe gestures are also available for control.

- **Tile Merging**: When two tiles with the same value are adjacent to each other and are moved in the same direction, they will merge into a single tile with a value twice that of the original tiles.

- **Objective**: Your goal is to reach the elusive 2048 tile. Keep merging tiles and strategizing your moves to achieve this high-value tile.

- **Game Over**: The game ends when there are no more empty tiles on the board, or when you successfully reach the 2048 tile. You can choose to continue and aim for an even higher score or start a new game.

Now that you know the rules, dive in and challenge yourself to reach the coveted 2048 tile! Good luck!
